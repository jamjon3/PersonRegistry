Identity Management Registry Source of Record

Person Registry will provide not only a source of record for data against an unlimited number of systems but will
also act to provide weighted searching and reconciliation so that identities in the system can remain unique
while also storing the various "keys" or identifiers to crossreference external systems of record so as to be
the master system of record against all other systems of record.
